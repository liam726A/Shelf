# Shelf

an open-sorce Shelf for you.  

### forwhat

For me, an online anon, The Online Activity is making URLs.  
write a blog, tweet a shitpost, make a homepage, spell a code on google colab for share, etc etc.  
but online enviroment are changing always (i think ten times faster than the real world), so sometimes I need to move an acoount.  
also, need to make a new account when start new The Online Activity for seccurity.  
but the problem is, changing the account means my online map = bookmarks and connection tied to it are being something far away.  
so i made a repository as study ("codeShelf") for keep the important bookmarks on one homepage.  
(most of important bookmarks for me was google colab page which i made before so codeShelf).  
it could be other programmers are thinking same way, so added the sharing code-bookmark page.  
and noticed, well, GitHub is very good for sharing code more than codeShelf.  
genius people who made GitHub also thought like me before ...?  

so my problem was solved thanks to super tool GitHub.  
and made a shelf for you.  

### model

Shelf's model is so simple.  
add the title and contents, choose the category, then automatically stored in each drawers on yourShelf.  
Bookmarks, Memos, Address Lists.  

so yourShelf is your space.  
drawers is mine.  
at first, i putted the caluculator on drawers but still under building.  
(i need to study javascript more for make it..)  
and next, made an encyclopedia of spells of code.  
in my knowledge from movie and twitter, stylish overseas countiries house's shelf have encyclopedias and ships or paints.  
and programmer is kind a people who like an encyclopedia, maybe ..?  
about drawers, i will put my-projects and looks-special-project for me.  

Shelf is an open-source project so everyone can use it.  
but sorry, still dont have login-feauture and doesnt check how it will work if not my enviroment.  
so maybe does not work now.  
if this Shelf will grow up, it will be good your shelf on the couner of github.  

Thank you.
